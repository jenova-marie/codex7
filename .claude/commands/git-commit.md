# Git Commit Command for Codex7

Create well-organized, properly attributed git commits for the Codex7 project.

## Instructions

You are helping create git commits for the Codex7 monorepo. Follow these guidelines:

### Commit Organization

1. **Group related changes logically** - Don't commit everything at once
   - Documentation changes together
   - Infrastructure/config changes together
   - Feature implementation by package
   - Tests with the code they test
   - Bug fixes isolated from features

2. **Commit frequently** - Smaller, focused commits are better than large ones
   - Each commit should represent one logical change
   - Commits should be atomic (can be reverted independently)
   - Prefer multiple small commits over one large commit

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commit format with emojis:

```
<emoji> <type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

#### Emoji Prefixes

- ✨ `feat:` - New features
- 🐛 `fix:` - Bug fixes
- 📝 `docs:` - Documentation only
- 🎨 `style:` - Code style/formatting (no logic change)
- ♻️ `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- 🧪 `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- 🔥 `perf:` - Performance improvements
- 🏗️ `chore:` - Build process, tooling, dependencies
- 🔒 `security:` - Security improvements
- 🐳 `docker:` - Docker-related changes
- 📦 `deps:` - Dependency updates
- 🚀 `deploy:` - Deployment configuration
- 🔧 `config:` - Configuration changes

#### Scopes (optional but encouraged)

- `shared` - @codex7/shared package
- `mcp-server` - @codex7/mcp-server package

- `storage-qdrant` - @codex7/storage-qdrant package
- `monorepo` - Root-level monorepo changes
- `ci` - CI/CD workflows
- `docker` - Docker configurations

#### Subject Line

- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added" or "adds")
- Don't capitalize first letter after type
- No period at the end
- Keep under 72 characters
- Be descriptive but concise

#### Body

- Separate from subject with blank line

2. **Review diff** - Run `git diff` to review actual changes
3. **Stage selectively** - Use `git add <files>` to stage related changes
4. **Commit with message** - Use heredoc format for multi-line messages:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
✨ feat(scope): subject line

- Bullet point describing change
- Another change in this commit
- Why this change was made

```

5. **Verify commit** - Run `git log -1 --pretty=fuller` to verify
6. **Push when ready** - `git push` or `git push -u origin <branch>`

### Special Cases

#### Breaking Changes

Add `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer:

```
✨ feat(api): redesign search endpoint response format

Change search endpoint to return paginated results:

- Add pagination metadata (page, total, hasMore)
- Nest results in 'data' field
- Include performance metrics in response

BREAKING CHANGE: Response format changed from flat array to object with
pagination. Clients must update to access results via response.data instead
of response directly.
