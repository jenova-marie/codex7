# Codex7 Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

**Version 1.0 - Effective January 2025**

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Codex7! ðŸ’œ

This Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") clarifies the terms under which you contribute to the project. By signing this CLA, you help us maintain Codex7 as truly open source while enabling a sustainable dual-licensing business model.

---

## Why Do We Need a CLA?

Codex7 uses **dual licensing**:

1. **AGPL v3** - Community Edition (free, open source forever)
2. **Commercial License** - Enterprise Edition (paid, for proprietary use)

The CLA allows us to:
- âœ… Keep Community Edition fully open source under AGPL v3
- âœ… Offer commercial licenses to enterprises who need them
- âœ… Ensure all contributors retain credit and copyright notices
- âœ… Protect the project from legal issues
- âœ… Build a sustainable business without compromising open source values

**This is NOT a copyright assignment** - you retain ownership of your contributions!

---

## The Simple Version

By contributing to Codex7, you agree that:

1. **You own your contribution** - You retain full copyright
2. **We can use it** - You grant us rights to use your code in both AGPL and Commercial editions
3. **It stays open** - Community Edition remains AGPL v3 forever
4. **You get credit** - Your name stays in the contributors list
5. **It's your original work** - You confirm you have the right to contribute it

That's it! Now let's look at the legal details.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I lose ownership of my code?

**No!** You retain full copyright. You're just giving us permission to use it in both open source and commercial editions.

### Can I still use my code elsewhere?

**Yes!** You can use your contribution anywhere you want, under any license you want.

### What if my employer owns my code?

You'll need your employer to sign a Corporate CLA, or get written permission to contribute.

### Can I revoke this agreement?

No. This is an irrevocable license, which ensures the project's long-term stability. However, you retain ownership and can still use your code however you want.

### Why not just use DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin)?

DCO is great for simple projects, but dual-licensing requires explicit patent and copyright grants. The CLA provides legal clarity for both open source users and commercial customers.

### Will you ever close-source the project?

**Never.** Community Edition will **always** be AGPL v3. This is our commitment to the open source community.

### What happens to my contribution if I don't sign the CLA?

We can't merge it. ðŸ˜¢ But we're happy to help you through the signing process!
