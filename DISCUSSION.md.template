# 🏗️ Codex7 Architecture Discussion

> **Collaborative architecture refinement workspace**
>
> This document captures the ongoing architectural discussion between teams to refine and validate the Codex7 database design.

## 📋 Discussion Metadata

**Participants:**
- **team-codex7** (Proposer) - Defending current DATABASE_DESIGN.md
- **team-codex7-storage** (Challenger) - Sr. Storage Architect perspective

**Document Location:** `/Users/jenova/projects/jenova-marie/codex7/DISCUSSION.md`

**Related Documents:**
- Primary Design: `docs/DATABASE_DESIGN.md`
- Architecture Questions: `QUESTIONS.md`
- Implementation Plan: `PLAN.md`

**Status:** 🟡 Active Discussion - Awaiting Storage Team Initial Review

---

## 🎯 Discussion Objectives

1. **Validate** the proposed PostgreSQL + pgvector architecture
2. **Identify** overlooked issues or edge cases
3. **Explore** alternative implementation approaches
4. **Optimize** for performance, scalability, and maintainability
5. **Reach consensus** on final architecture before implementation

## 📊 Current Proposed Architecture (Summary)

### Core Design
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 16 + pgvector
- **Hardware:** AWS EC2 t3.medium (4GB RAM, 50GB SSD)
- **Embedding Model:** OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (1536 dims)
- **Vector Index:** IVFFlat with 100 lists (cosine similarity)
- **Chunking:** Hybrid structural (markdown headers, 512 token max)
- **Schema:** Unified 3-table design (libraries → versions → documents)

### Key Decisions
1. **Unified schema** - Single `documents` table for all source types (GitHub, web, PDF)
2. **IVFFlat over HNSW** - Better for <1M vectors, lower memory, faster builds
3. **512 token chunks** - Balance between context and precision
4. **SHA-256 deduplication** - Reuse embeddings for identical content
5. **No LlamaIndex** - Custom pipeline for MVP, full control

## 💬 Discussion Thread

### Round 1: Initial Storage Team Review

**Status:** ⏳ Awaiting team-codex7-storage analysis

**Instructions to Storage Team:**
- Read `docs/DATABASE_DESIGN.md` thoroughly as a Sr. Storage Architect
- Use sequential thinking to analyze the architecture rationale
- Identify overlooked areas, potential issues, or better alternatives
- Think deeply about:
  - Schema design (normalized vs denormalized trade-offs)
  - Index strategy (IVFFlat vs HNSW vs alternatives)
  - Query performance patterns
  - Scaling challenges (100k → 1M documents)
  - Storage efficiency
  - Operational complexity
- Propose questions and alternative approaches
- Update this document with your findings

**Expected Deliverables:**
1. List of questions/concerns about current design
2. Alternative approaches (if any) with trade-off analysis
3. Identified risks or edge cases we missed
4. Recommendations for improvements
