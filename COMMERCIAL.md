## 🎯 Our Philosophy

Codex7 exists because we believe in **real open source** - not the "open-core facade" that plagues so much of our industry. This document explains how we plan to build a sustainable business without compromising that principle.

**Core Commitment:** The complete indexing infrastructure, MCP server, and all core functionality will **always** remain AGPL v3-licensed and fully functional.

---

## 🤝 What This Means

### We Will NEVER

- ❌ Hide core indexing logic behind proprietary APIs
- ❌ Paywall basic features that belong in community edition
- ❌ Create artificial limitations to force upgrades
- ❌ Lock you into our hosted service
- ❌ Require licensing for self-hosted community edition
- ❌ Pull a "bait and switch" by re-licensing core components

### We WILL

- ✅ Keep all indexing, storage, and MCP code open source forever
- ✅ Make community edition genuinely useful for individuals and small teams
- ✅ Charge for enterprise features that cost us to build and support
- ✅ Offer managed hosting for those who want convenience
- ✅ Provide professional services for complex integrations
- ✅ Accept community contributions to ALL editions (with appropriate CLAs)
- ✅ Be transparent about our roadmap and pricing

## 🔐 Why AGPL v3 Instead of MIT?

We chose the **GNU Affero General Public License v3** for our Community Edition to ensure Codex7 remains truly open source while building a sustainable business.

### The Problem with Permissive Licenses

**MIT and other permissive licenses** allow anyone to:
- Take the code, modify it, and offer it as a proprietary SaaS
- Hide their improvements behind closed APIs
- Never contribute back to the community
- Essentially "close-source" open-source software

This is exactly what we're fighting against with projects like context7!

### How AGPL v3 Protects Open Source

**AGPL v3** ensures that:
- ✅ Anyone using Codex7 over a network must share their source code
- ✅ Improvements and modifications flow back to the community
- ✅ Companies can't create proprietary forks without releasing source
- ✅ The "SaaS loophole" in regular GPL is closed

### You Can Still Use It Freely

**AGPL v3 is NOT anti-commercial.** You can:
- ✅ Use Codex7 commercially in your organization
- ✅ Modify it for your own needs
- ✅ Deploy it internally without sharing source
- ✅ Build proprietary products on top (using the API)

**The only requirement:** If you modify Codex7 and offer it as a network service (e.g., SaaS), you must share your modifications under AGPL v3.

### Commercial License Option

**Need to use Codex7 in a proprietary product?** We offer commercial licensing for:
- Embedding Codex7 in your proprietary software
- Offering Codex7-based SaaS without open-sourcing your modifications
- OEM and white-label deployments
- Enterprise features and support

This dual-licensing model lets us:
- 💜 Keep Community Edition truly open source
- 💰 Build a sustainable business
- 🤝 Serve both open source and enterprise users
