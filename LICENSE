Unlike some projects that claim to be "open source" while hiding their core
functionality behind proprietary APIs, this license actually means something
because you can run the entire Codex7 system! ðŸš€

The MIT License ensures:
âœ… You can use Codex7 commercially
âœ… You can modify and distribute it
âœ… You can self-host it privately
âœ… You own your data
âœ… Full transparency - no hidden backends

This is what real open-source looks like. ðŸ’œ
