## 💡 Positive Community Examples

### In Slack:

✅ **Good**: "Hey @newbie, welcome! That's a great question about vector search. Let me point you to our docs..."

❌ **Bad**: "That's a stupid question. Just read the docs."

### In Code Reviews:

✅ **Good**: "This approach works, but have you considered using the Result type for error handling? It would make this more robust. Here's an example..."

❌ **Bad**: "This code is terrible. You clearly don't understand TypeScript."

### In Discussions:

✅ **Good**: "I see your perspective on using SQLite. My concern is scalability for larger deployments. What if we supported both through the adapter pattern?"
